"""
This script takes a start curve and produces a loft object by duplicating, scaling and rotating
It contours the lofted form and creates a continuous polyline 
Extracts points from the polyline
Create Gcode from points - X,Y,Z
Add to start and end Gcode
Export a .GCODE file
"""

# select start curve

# Copy, move and rotate curve

# Loft to make surface

# Contour the surface

# Divide contour lines into points - put into nested list


# add a base using the start curve - concentric curves + contours















# end up with a spirtalised curve for convertion into G-code
